# A workout tracker, built with Python, utilizing the Nutritionix API and Sheety API.
This is a work out tracker with the purpose of getting a "query" from the user, and have it posted to a google sheet prepared by the user. The convience of this project is that you don't need to manually calculate calories burnt, as this application utlizes the Nutritionix API's Natural Language Query for exercise to grab information from a user's statement, such as the workout type and time spent, and calculate the calories burnt for them! This data will be posted to a Google Sheet so that the user can easily track how much calories they've burnt. It can further be used for a monthly burndown chart of calories with some extra formatting with the addition of the time of entry and date.

Here is an example of a query a user can post

A post request here and there and BAM!

Pretty neat huh? 

## Purpose of this project
This is primarly for me getting more familiar with using external system's APIs, reading their documentation, and trying to build something from it.
